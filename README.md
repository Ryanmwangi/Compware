# [CompareWare](https://compareware.org/)

CompareWare is an open-source platform for comparing tools (software, hardware, etc.) with structured, crowdsourced data.
It combines Rust's **Leptos** for a modern, reactive frontend and **Nostr** for decentralized data storage (TBI).

## **Features**
- **Item Management**: Add, view, and manage items with metadata and key-value tags.
- **Nostr Integration**: 
  - Store and share data as Nostr events.
  - Authenticate users with Nostr keys.
- **Future Features**: Reviews and a Web of Trust for collaborative insights.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Leptos framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://forge.ftt.gmbh/ryanmwangi/Compware.git
   cd compareware
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   cargo leptos serve
   ```
3. Open your browser at [localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)

## **Database Schema**
### Key Concepts
- **PK (Primary Key)**: Unique identifier for table records (üîë)
- **FK (Foreign Key)**: Reference linking related tables (‚û°Ô∏è)
- **Core (core properties)**: name and description.

### Tables Overview

| Table | Columns (PK/FK) | Description | Example Data |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **urls** | `id` (PK), `url`, `created_at` | Stores comparison URLs | `1, "/laptops", 2024-03-01` |
| **items** | `id` (PK), `url_id` (FK), `wikidata_id` | Comparison items | `"item1", 1, "Q214276"` |
| **properties** | `id` (PK), `name` | All available properties (including core) | `1.0, "name"`<br>`2.0, "description"`<br>`3.0, "screen_size"` |
| **item_properties** | `item_id` (PK/FK), `property_id` (PK/FK), `value` | All property values including name/description | `"item1", 1.0, "MacBook Pro"`<br>`"item1", 2.0, "16-inch laptop"`<br>`"item1", 3.0, "16 inches"` |
| **selected_properties** | `url_id` (PK/FK), `property_id` (PK/FK) | Active properties per URL (excludes core) | `1, 3.0` |

    Wikidata-->>App: Return properties (IDs + values)
    
    App->>Wikidata: fetch_property_labels()
    Wikidata-->>App: Return labels
    App->>App: Combine labels + properties
    App->>User: Show labeled properties
```
## **Docker Deployment**

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### **Running with Docker**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://forge.ftt.gmbh/ryanmwangi/Compware.git
   cd compareware
   ```
2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Access the application at: [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)


## **Running Tests**

CompareWare uses both native Rust tests and WebAssembly (WASM) tests for browser-based components.

### **Native Rust Tests**
To run native Rust tests (for server-side or non-WASM code):

```bash
cargo test
```

### **WASM (Browser) Tests**

To run tests for browser-based (Leptos/WASM) components, you need to use [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/):

1. **Install wasm-pack** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   cargo install wasm-pack
   ```

2. **Run tests in a headless browser (Chrome or Firefox):**

   ```bash
   wasm-pack test --headless --chrome --features wasm-test --no-default-features
   ```

   Or, for Firefox:

   ```bash
   wasm-pack test --headless --firefox --features wasm-test --no-default-features
   ```

3. **Run tests in Node.js** (if your tests do not require a browser environment):

   ```bash
   wasm-pack test --node --features wasm-test --no-default-features
   ```

#### **Notes**
- Make sure your test functions are annotated with `#[wasm_bindgen_test]` for WASM tests.
- If you add new test files, place them in the `tests/` directory or as modules in `src/` as appropriate.
- Warnings about unused variables or imports can be ignored unless they affect test results.

For more details on WASM testing, see the [wasm-bindgen-test documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/usage.html).
